#   [servlet] []
#   provide foundation for web-apps
#   java class, which deals with client requests
#   servlet container manages servlets

#   input req -> servlet container(tomcat) -> uses web.xml to determine which servlet to invoke -> servlet container(tomcat) -> response

#   [spring framework] []
#   fixed issues with servlets like removal of web.xml(hectic to maintain all api related stuff)
#   spring has annotation based configuration
#   spring has IoC : manage object dependencies and dependency injection 
#   spring makes unit testing easier
#   each servlet can have only 1 doGet{}/doPut{}, spring fixes it

#   REQUEST -> servlet container -> dispatcher servlet ([first controller in Spring Mvc project][])-> 
#           1. choose controller : uses HandlerMapping
#           2. create instance : IoC (create instance of controller along with its dependencies)
#           3. invokes controller methods : respective api gets invoked
#   response -> dispatcher servlet -> servlet container -> RESPONSE

#   [@EnableWebMvc] loads all dependencies required for spring mvc 

#   [spring boot vs spring mvc] []
#   1. [dependency management] [] : in spring boot no need to maintain dependency version only starter parent is 
#       needed to have version specs
#   2. [auto configuration] [] : spring boot :: no need to configure dispatcher servlet, app config, 
#       enableWebMvc, ComponentScan (Starts from main method package), separate component scan base package can 
#       be given
#   [@SpringBootApplication] has EnableWebMvc, ComponentScan, AutoConfiguration
#   3. [Embedded server] [] : no need to deploy war separately


#   [Spring Boot] []
#   helps to create prod ready apps
#   based on spring framework
#   supports convention over configuration : uses default values for configuration
#   run app as quick as possible

#   [jar] : java archive :: standalone java apps
#   [war] : web archive :: html, css, js, java apps i.e. complete package

#   [layered archi] []
#   client -> [controller, service, repository layer <> DB] []

#   [DTO] : 
#   req dto mapping of client data to java objects, 
#   res dto mapping of java obj to response

#   [utility] : common among more than 1 class
#   [entity] : POJOs :: direct representation of table :: to deal with DB
#   [configuration] : application.properties

#   [maven] :
#   project management tool, build generation, dependency resolution, documentation
#   uses POM
#   [ant vs maven] [] : ant :: what and how to do, maven : what to do
#   each POM is child of superPom.xml
#   properties => key value pair for config, property key can be referenced anywhere in POM
#   repositories => maven looks for dependencies and download their jars
#   with build maven starts project set up
#   inside build we provide plugins to perform our tasks
#   in phase : one of 7 phases is given, in goal inside executions -> execution, we provide task
#   in configuration : we can provide xml config for code validation
#   


#   [maven lifecycle] []
#   validate Project structure [-->] compile source code [-->] test the code (unit test) 
#   [-->] package compiled code (jar/war)
#   [-->] verify the integrity of package [-->] install the package in local repository 
#   [-->] deploy the package in remote repository.

#   [validate project structure] [] mvn validate : currently hidden
#   [compile source code] [] compiles code and creates .class files
#   [test source code] [] tests source code with test cases written in *test.java
#   [package compiled code] [] creates .jar files and puts in local repo

#   [verify integrity of packaged code] [] finds unused variables, imports, empty catch block, no usage of objects, 
#   finds duplicate code.
#   pmd -> source code analyzer for static code analysis
#   [install package in local repo] []
#   maven install : installs pkgs in local maven repo (home directory)
#   settings.xml we can provide path to store downloaded artifacts

#   [deploy package in remote repo] []
#   pom.xml -> in distribution management url is given where pkg is to get deployed
#   deployment can be in company's central repo or public maven repo
#   to authenticate credentials are mentioned in settings.xml for deployment
#   Since maven central is public, no need to provide username and password

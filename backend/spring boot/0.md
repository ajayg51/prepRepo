#   [servlet] []
#   provide foundation for web-apps
#   java class, which deals with client requests
#   servlet container manages servlets

#   input req -> servlet container(tomcat) -> uses web.xml to determine which servlet to invoke -> servlet container(tomcat) -> response

#   [spring framework] []
#   fixed issues with servlets like removal of web.xml(hectic to maintain all api related stuff)
#   spring has annotation based configuration
#   spring has IoC : manage object dependencies and dependency injection 
#   spring makes unit testing easier
#   each servlet can have only 1 doGet{}/doPut{}, spring fixes it

#   REQUEST -> servlet container -> dispatcher servlet ([first controller in Spring Mvc project][])-> 
#           1. choose controller : uses HandlerMapping
#           2. create instance : IoC (create instance of controller along with its dependencies)
#           3. invokes controller methods : respective api gets invoked
#   response -> dispatcher servlet -> servlet container -> RESPONSE

#   [@EnableWebMvc] loads all dependencies required for spring mvc 

#   [spring boot vs spring mvc] []
#   1. [dependency management] [] : in spring boot no need to maintain dependency version only starter parent is 
#       needed to have version specs
#   2. [auto configuration] [] : spring boot :: no need to configure dispatcher servlet, app config, 
#       enableWebMvc, ComponentScan (Starts from main method package), separate component scan base package can 
#       be given
#   [@SpringBootApplication] has EnableWebMvc, ComponentScan, AutoConfiguration
#   3. [Embedded server] [] : no need to deploy war separately


#   [Spring Boot] []
#   helps to create prod ready apps
#   based on spring framework
#   supports convention over configuration : uses default values for configuration
#   run app as quick as possible

#   [jar] : java archive :: standalone java apps
#   [war] : web archive :: html, css, js, java apps i.e. complete package

#   [layered archi] []
#   client -> [controller, service, repository layer <> DB] []

#   [DTO] : 
#   req dto mapping of client data to java objects, 
#   res dto mapping of java obj to response

#   [utility] : common among more than 1 class
#   [entity] : POJOs :: direct representation of table :: to deal with DB
#   [configuration] : application.properties

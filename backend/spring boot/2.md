#   [bean scope] []
#   [singleton], [prototype], [request], [session], [application]
#   [singleton] default scope, only 1 instance created per IoC, eagerly initialized by IoC

#   after all bean creation, dependency injection, calling @PostConstruct any of api calling is done.

#   [prototype]
#   each time a new object is created, lazily initialized

#   [request]
#   new object is created for each http request
#   lazily initialized

#   for eagerly initialized objects to solve dependency injection issue we can use proxy mode with request 
#   scoped objects

#   [session]
#   new object created for each http session
#   lazy initialized
#   on accessing any endpoint, session is created
#   remains active, until session expires

#   [application] similar to singleton, just 1 instance in all IoCs

#   [1] using [@Qualifier] we can assign different bean to respective fields and use accordingly [industry usage] []

#   [2] creating custom bean in config file, to do this bean classes are deprived of [@Component] so as to stop 
#   Spring from managing them, use [@Value({placeholder})] to decide type object to deal with
#   [@Value] gets its placeholder value either from property file, environment variable or inline literals 
#   [inline literal] [](provide values directly) 

#   [imp] order of annotations matter in spring, so [@Qualifier] comes before [@Component]

#   [@ConditionalOnProperty] beans should mark @Autowired(required = false)
#   if @Autowired : required is kept true, Spring will try to resolve this dependency
#   bean is created conditionally
#   @ConditionalOnProperty(prefix[name], 
#   value[key name to which value is to be assigned in app.properties] [], 
#   in app.properties : prefix.value -> key, value string is matched with havingValue String
#   havingValue[string matches with app.properties] [],
#   matchIfMissing[value to be used if entry missing in app.properties] [])

#   [advtg]
#   toggling of feature
#   avoid cluttering app context with unnecessary beans
#   save memory
#   reduce app start up time

#   [disadvtg]
#   misconfiguration can happen
#   code complexity increases when over-used
#   multiple bean creation with same configuration, brings confusion [same key for multiple bean][]
#   complexity in managing

#   [@Profile] intended for environment separation, can also be used to create app specific beans
#   app-dev.properties, app-qa.properties, app-prod.properties basis profile
#   using spring.profiles.active in app.properties we can set different profile app.properties
#   if some property being used is not present in profile being used then it will pick default properties value
#   child properties file gets priority over parent file for overridden keys, if not present parent values are 
#   used.
#   [Profiling] profile can be given at runtime or with an entry in pom.xml
#   [@Profile] to create bean only when particular profile is set
#   multiple profiles can be given comma separated, the last one will be picked up in such use case but both 
#   profile beans will be created.

#   profiling : strictly for different environments
#   [@ConditionalOnProperty] for condition basis creation of beans

#   [Spring AOP] []
#   helps to intercept method invokation, execute some task before and after method execution
#   allows to focus on business logic by handling boilerplate and repititive code like logging, transaction
#   management etc.
#   Aspect is a module which handles boilerplate and repititive code
#   helps in achieving reusability and maintainability of code.

#   [usage]
#   logging, transaction management, security

#   [@Before(pointCut)]
#   pointCut : path of function with return type and access modifier[optional]
#   pointcut - execution(path of method)
#   [execution] - tries to map to a particular method.
#   wildcard - * or ..
#   * : strictly matches any single item, can be used instead of any single item like return type, method name
#   .. : 0 or more items, in package name replace . with [..] to look for subpackage as well

#   [within] - matches all methods within a class or package
#   [@within] - matches all methods for a given class level annotation like @Service
#   [@annotation] - matches all methods  for a given method level annotation like @GetMapping  
#   [args] - matches all methods for given arguments, for objects of a class full classpath need to be given
#   [@args] - matches any method with argument as class having specified annotation
#   [target] - mathces any method on a particular instance of class, full classpath is given
#   whenever a method is called using instance same as that in target aop method will get executed
#   instead of class, interface path can be given as well.

#   all pointcuts can be combined using logical operators like &&, || etc.
#   [named pointcuts] [] 
#   using @Pointcut("expression with path") above void method name we can have custom point cuts
#   and use that point cut method name() within @Before() or @After()

#   [advice] an action that gets executed before/ after/ around method execution
#   [@Around] action takes place before and after method execution
#   in case of @Before, @After method call is handled internally
#   but in case of @Around, we have to handle method call using proceedingJoinPoint.proceed()
#   [join point] [] a point where actual method invocation takes place
#
